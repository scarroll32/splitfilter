# Split Filter

_What's a SplitFilter?_

Split Filter printing is a [photographic darkroom technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkroom#:~:text=One%20method%20of%20photographic%20printing,to%20create%20a%20single%20print.) used to control the density of shadows differently from the density of the highlights. It's how we improved photos before Photoshop.

This website will house my collection of darkroom and digital photos.
