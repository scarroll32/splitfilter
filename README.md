# SplitFilter

_What's a SplitFilter?_

Split Filter printing is a [photographic darkroom technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkroom#:~:text=One%20method%20of%20photographic%20printing,to%20create%20a%20single%20print.) used to control the density of shadows differently from the density of the highlights. It's how we improved photos in the darkroom, before Photoshop.
